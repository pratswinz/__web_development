The hashcode of a Java Object is simply a number, it is 32-bit signed int, that allows an object to be 
managed by a hash-based data structure. We know that hash code is an unique id number allocated to an object by JVM. 
But actually speaking, Hash code is not an unique number for an object. If two objects are equals then these two objects should return same hash code. 
So we have to implement hashcode() method of a class in such way that if two objects are equals, ie compared by equal() method of that class,
then those two objects must return same hash code. 
If you are overriding hashCode you need to override equals method also.





var arrPrint = function(arr){
	foreach(item in arr){
		if(Object.prototype.toString.call( item )=== '[object Array]'){
			arrPrint(item);
		}else{
			console.log(item);
		}
	}			
}

arrPrint([1,3,'sum',[4,90,[35,76],95],8,33]);
